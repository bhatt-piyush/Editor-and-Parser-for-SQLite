This software is a SQLite Editor and Parser. As its name suggests, it provides a user friendly environment for executing SQLite commands over a database. Additionally it parses the SQLite commands before executing on the database and thus assisting with the process of debugging.

SQLite Editor and Parser provides a very rich editing environment with full text highlighting and a lot more features to ease the Database management. Due to the attractive GUI of the software it is more comfortable to work on the database as compared to working on the SQLite command line interface.

Some distinguishing features of the SQLite Editor and Parser are:

•	Syntax Highlighting: The SQL statements written inside the editor are properly highlighted to provide the rich editing environment. 
•	Easy Debugging: All the SQL statements before being executed on the database are first parsed for any syntax errors and thus a lot of errors are caught in a much safer and in earlier steps. 
•	Lightweight: The software is extremely lightweight and can run on any machine having JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
•	Simple to use: The software is designed in a way so as to cater to the user’s ease. Its functionality is simple and easy to use as compared to SQLite’s command line.
•	Uses SQLite: This software used SQLite, which is arguably the most widely used SQL RDBMS.
•	Atomic Transactions: It provides a very easy “Click-and-go” functionality for performing atomic transaction. 
•	Syntax Hint: There are hints available for the mismatched string type of syntax errors.
•	GUI: This provides a GUI for managing the database rather than a command line interface as provided by SQLite.
